## Getting Data: Clean and Tidy


*.) This is a Peer-Graded Coursera Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data in R. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to clean raw samples of data files into a tidy data for later analysis. The original data is downloaded from the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) database, UCI Machine Learning repo.


*.) This submission is a work of KevB93, provided with the following files available in GitHub repo:
    
    1.) README.md (self-explanatory)
    2.) run_analysis.R (R script with codes)
    3.) CodeBook.md (provides further information of run_analysis.R, indicating all the variables, calculations, and methods of transformation)
    4.) tidy_dataset.txt (Finalized clean, tidy data)
    
    
*.) run_analysis.R prepares data and conducts data cleaning as per project guideline: 

    1.) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2.) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3.) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4.) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5.) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
